## Author note
I really like Neo4j and I wanted to use it with PHP. But after I looked on official php library, I was really disappointed. Too much dependencies. I don't like if I have to install 10 things because of one. First I decided to use HTTP API for communication, but it wasn't fast enough. I went through bolt protocol documentation and I said to myself, why not to create own simpler library?
